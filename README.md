Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=========================================


There are four main files is this repository:

1.  run_analysis.R:  This is the R script that will load the training and
        testing, tidy them up, and then writes the tidy.txt file.
                
        NOTE:  In order for this R script to work, the original
        UNZIPPED data from UCI must be in the working directory
        in a sub folder called "UCI HAR Dataset".
                
2.  CodeBook.md:  This file describes the data from the UCI HAR Dataset,
        what columns were extracted from it, and how the tidy.txt
        files was created.
                
3.  tidy.txt:  This is the tidy dataset that was created when running the
        run_analysis.R file.
                
4.  README.md:  This readme file (version 3.1.4159)
